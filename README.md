# Think-Aloud Visualization & Analysis Tool

### The tool is designed for the University of Toronto CSC428/CSC2514 class. This tool visualizes the transcript and the pitch information of an audio recorded usability testing session (e.g. one that follows the thinking aloud protocol). The tool is provided to students to facilitate the implementation of another way of visualizing pitch information with its corresponding transcript.

#### This code is an implementation of the project done by Yomna Omar, Dana Alpysbayeva, and Jessica Miao.
